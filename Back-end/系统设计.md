## 消息通知系统设计

How are notifications pushed to our phones or PCs? 
A messaging solution (Firebase) can be used to support the notification push. The diagram below shows how Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) works.

FCM is a cross-platform messaging solution that can compose, send, queue, and route notifications reliably. It provides a unified API between message senders (app servers) and receivers (client apps). The app developer can use this solution to drive user retention.

Steps 1 - 2: When the client app starts for the first time, the client app sends credentials to FCM, including Sender ID, API Key, and App ID. FCM generates Registration Token for the client app instance (so the Registration Token is also called Instance ID).

This token must be included in the notifications. Step 3: The client app sends the Registration Token to the app server. The app server caches the token for subsequent communications.

Over time, the app server has too many tokens to maintain, so the recommended practice is to store the token with timestamps and to remove stale tokens from time to time.

Step 4: There are two ways to send messages. One is to compose messages directly in the console GUI (Step 4.1,) and the other is to send the messages from the app server (Step 4.2.) We can use the Firebase Admin SDK or HTTP for the latter.

Step 5: FCM receives the messages, and queues the messages in the storage if the devices are not online.

Step 6: FCM forwards the messages to platform-level transport. This transport layer handles platform-specific configurations.

Step 7: The messages are routed to the targeted devices. The notifications can be displayed according to the configurations sent from the app server

## 密码存储在DB中的设计

![[Pasted image 20220711095009.png]]

Storing passwords in plain text is not a good idea because anyone with internal access can see them.  Storing password hashes directly is insufficient because it is pruned to precomputation attacks, such as rainbow tables. To mitigate this, we salt the passwords.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐭? According to OWASP guidelines, “a salt is a unique, randomly generated string that is added to each password as part of the hashing process”.

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐚𝐥𝐭?  
- A salt is not meant to be secret and it can be stored in plain text in the database. It is used to ensure the hash result is unique to each password.
- The password can be stored in the database using the following format: 𝘩𝘢𝘴𝘩( 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥 + 𝘴𝘢𝘭𝘵).

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝? To validate a password, it can go through the following process:
- A client enters the password.
- The system fetches the corresponding salt from the database.
- The system appends the salt to the password and hashes it. Let’s call the hashed value H1.
- The system compares H1 and H2, where H2 is the hash stored in the database. If they are the same, the password is valid.
