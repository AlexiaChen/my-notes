#### DELETE peration in MySQL if it will block INSERT operation?

Yes, the `DELETE` operation in MySQL can block the `INSERT` operation on the same table. When a `DELETE` statement is executed, it can set record locks on every index record that is scanned, which may block the `INSERT` operation by other sessions into the gaps covered by the index records. Additionally, a statement like `DELETE FROM YourTable;` would take out a table lock, blocking all other changes to the table until it is done[4].

If a `DELETE` operation takes a long time to execute, it could potentially block `INSERT` operations on the same table until it is completed. The duration of the blockage would depend on the specific isolation level and the locks set by the `DELETE` statement[2][4].

In scenarios where you need to perform a `DELETE` and an `INSERT` in a way that minimizes the impact on other operations, it's advisable to carefully consider the potential locking and blocking effects and, if possible, perform the operations during periods of low activity or use alternative strategies such as batching the operations or using temporary tables[5].

Therefore, it's important to be mindful of the potential impact of long-running `DELETE` operations on `INSERT` operations and to consider the specific requirements and constraints of your application when designing data manipulation processes.

#### if use soft delete , it will block?

Yes, when using soft delete, the `DELETE` operation will not block the `INSERT` operation, as the soft delete typically involves updating a field (e.g., setting a `deleted` flag to true) instead of physically removing the record from the database. This allows the record to remain in the table but be logically excluded from query results unless explicitly requested.

Soft delete is a technique that marks records as deleted without actual erasure from the database, preventing the deleted record from being selected in normal queries[3]. This means that the `INSERT` operation will not be blocked by the soft delete process, as the record is not physically removed from the table.

Therefore, when using soft delete, the `DELETE` operation does not block the `INSERT` operation, as the record is not actually deleted from the table, but rather marked as deleted through a flag or similar mechanism.

#### if the DELETE operation affects a bunch of rows of data, the mysql used disk will reduce immediately?

When a large number of rows are deleted from a MySQL table, the disk space is not immediately released. The actual disk space will be released only when the table is optimized or when new data is inserted, causing the table to grow and the old data to be overwritten[1][3][4].

For example, if you delete 10,000 rows from a 500GB InnoDB table, the table size on the filesystem will not immediately decrease. The size of the `ibdata1` file will not reduce until the table is optimized or new data is inserted, causing the table to grow and the old data to be overwritten[1].

To release the disk space after deleting rows, you can run the `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command, which will reclaim the free space left by the deleted rows[3][4]. Alternatively, you can use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` command to clear up all rows in the table, returning the space back to the operating system[5]. However, keep in mind that these operations may require locking the table and could potentially block other operations on the table.

In summary, when a large number of rows are deleted from a MySQL table, the disk space is not immediately released. You need to run the `OPTIMIZE TABLE` or `TRUNCATE TABLE` commands to release the disk space after deleting the rows[3][4][5].

#### if I never call OPTIMIZE TABLE or TRUNCATE TABLE, the used disk of MySQL will release after a period of time?

No, if you never call `OPTIMIZE TABLE` or `TRUNCATE TABLE`, the used disk space of MySQL will not release after a period of time. When a large number of rows are deleted from a MySQL table, the disk space is not immediately released, and the actual disk space will be released only when the table is optimized or when new data is inserted, causing the table to grow and the old data to be overwritten[1][3][4].

If you do not optimize or truncate the table, the deleted rows will remain in the table, and the disk space will not be released. This can lead to disk space issues and performance degradation over time, especially if the table is frequently updated or deleted.

Therefore, it's important to regularly optimize or truncate tables to release the disk space used by deleted rows and maintain optimal performance and disk space usage.

#### OPTIMIZE TABLE is slow? it will lead operation of writing issues on production environment?

Yes, the `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command can be slow, especially for large tables, and it can potentially lead to write issues on a production environment. When you run `OPTIMIZE TABLE`, it locks the table, which can cause write operations to be blocked until the optimization is complete[1][3].

The duration of the lock depends on the size of the table and the storage engine used. For example, InnoDB tables can take longer to optimize than MyISAM tables, and larger tables can take longer to optimize than smaller tables[1][4].

To minimize the impact of `OPTIMIZE TABLE` on write operations, you can consider running the command during periods of low activity or using alternative strategies such as partitioning the table or using a rolling maintenance approach[1][3]. Additionally, you can use tools such as pt-online-schema-change or gh-ost to perform online schema changes without blocking write operations[1].

In summary, `OPTIMIZE TABLE` can be slow and can potentially lead to write issues on a production environment. It's important to carefully consider the potential impact of the command and to use alternative strategies or tools to minimize the impact on write operations.

#### but if the table is continuely INSERT new data, maybe I do not need care the DELETE operation lead to issue that disk not release, right?

If you have a continuous stream of `INSERT` operations, and you do not need to care about the `DELETE` operation causing disk space issues, you can consider the following approaches:

1. **Monitor disk space**: Keep an eye on the disk space usage of your MySQL server and the filesystem where the table files are stored. If the disk space starts to fill up, you can take appropriate action, such as optimizing the table or moving to a larger storage capacity[5].

2. **Use InnoDB Autocommmit**: InnoDB has a feature called autocommit, which writes changes to the database in small, asynchronous transactions. This can help in reducing the impact of `INSERT` operations on disk space usage, as the changes will be written to the database as soon as they are executed[1].

3. **Optimize the table when possible**: Although `INSERT` operations can cause disk space issues, you can still optimize the table periodically to release the disk space used by deleted rows. This can be done during periods of low activity or by using alternative strategies such as partitioning the table or using a rolling maintenance approach[3][4].

4. **Consider using a different storage engine**: If you are using MyISAM as the storage engine, you can switch to a more suitable storage engine like InnoDB, which handles disk space more efficiently when it comes to deleting rows[5].

Remember that these approaches are not ideal for all situations, and it's essential to monitor the disk space usage and performance of your MySQL server to ensure optimal performance and disk space management.
