[(1) Haym 在 Twitter: "(1/17) Cryptography Basics: Polynomial Commitments Creating unique digital fingerprints is core to cryptography. We use tools like hashing to provide cryptographic-certainty without revealing any info. But hashing is so destructive, is there a better way to commit to data? https://t.co/TpGAskL5qF" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/SalomonCrypto/status/1581462447491194880)
