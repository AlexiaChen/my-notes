#### 问题

为什么Paillier比El-Gamal更多地被用在ECDSA的门限化上 

```txt
You need a homomorphic encryption scheme which can work with scalars. ElGamal encrypts group elements. Now, what you could do is split the scalar into like 8 bit limbs and do multiple encryptions, but then you need to handle overflows and it gets messy.

You can use El Gamal to homomorphically encrypt arbitrary fixed-size scalars by breaking them into separately El-Gamal encrypted limbs, with the size of the limbs sufficiently small that the decrypter can run baby-step/giant-step to get the discrete log of the plaintext, i guess.
